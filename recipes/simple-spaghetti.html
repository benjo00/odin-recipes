    <p>Extreme skepticism is the belief that we cannot know anything whatsoever. This belief self refutes, because, if you can't know anything, then you cannot know the position of not knowing anything, either. More mild skepticism, is, of course, exempt from this self refutation. We can, and certainly should be skeptical about some things. However being extremely skeptical about all things is invalid.</p>
