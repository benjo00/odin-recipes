    <h2>This is the easiest, fastest way to make spaghetti with sorcery. It tastes great, too!</h2>
<p>If you're low on time, energy, money, or all three, then this dish is for you!</p>
<p>This is one of the first dishes I ever learned how to make, and you'll see why: it's very straightforward, and can be made with nothing!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>uncooked spaghetti noodles</li>
    <li>red sauce (or really any sauce you like)</li>
    <li>parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Cast a spell to summon all the items.</li>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti per the instructions on the box it came in, then drain it, and pour the spaghetti onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce onto it. The spaghetti will be hot enough to warm up the sauce. If it's not hot enough for you, you can always heat the sauce separately.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parmesan (optional), and eat!</li>


    </ol>
