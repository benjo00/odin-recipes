    <p>Idealism seems like a lot of fun. Nothing is real! It's all in your mind! Neat! But, any rational person can see some serious flaws, here. First, go ahead and try to change something. Seriously, imagine billions of dollars worth of gold coins into your closet. Now, check your closet. Any coins? Try imagining food into your stomach. Did it work? Didn't think so. And of course we could do infinite experiments like that, and not one would work, except some absurdly small things, like quantum level events. But those require interpretation, and are too small to actually see anyway. If you can't actually directly sense it in the first place, and are relying on many levels of inference, you can't make a broad claim that it disproves all commonsense reality, and this type of thing would self refute anyway, as can be seen demonstrated in the <a href="./commonSense.html">Common Sense</a> page. Further, keep in mind that for every interpretation that claims quantum mechanics proves some idealism type idea, there is an interpretation that completely contradicts this notion, and plants physics right back on solid ground. For an example, see Rodney Brooks "Fields of Color."</p>

    <p>Now, there are many kinds of idealism, but fundamental to all of them is they deny a significant amount of reality to the objective world, or even all of it, and they cast a huge doubt, or entirely refute the senses. None of this works, because if nothing is real, then the poisiton "nothing is real" cannot be real. If your senses and mind are completely unreliable, since they are founded on the commonsense understanding of the world, in which objects exist outside of mind, and that understanding is completely false, then your position falls apart.</p>

    <p>Wittgenstein put it thusly:
      "We can’t doubt anything without exempting certain other things from doubt. Thus the basic position is that even philosophical doubt requires non-doubt (or belief). That is, in order to get the game of doubt underway, certain things must be placed beyond doubt."
    </p>

    <p>In other words, some things MUST be real, or else you have no position whatsoever. For all intents and purposes, the commonsense world built by your mind and senses, being the bare minimum and what all is built on, must be real, and providing real, reliable data. If they are not, then any information built by, or learned by them must also be invalid.</p>

<p>Idealism is not a valid position.</p>

    <p>Sure, some will infinitely eel wriggle around and try to argue versions of quasi idealism that are somehow ostensibly valid, despite these fatal flaws. But, if they are so light on idealism as to allow commonsense reality to stand, then they are not really idealism. If they are too far over the line so as to contradict commonsense reality, then they are invalid. there is no grey area.</p>

    <p>For a thorough example of how and why the commonsense world can never be entirely refuted in a valid philosophy, and what the alternatives are, please see the <a href=./commonSense.html>Common Sense</a> page.</p> 

<p>In a very strange twist of fate, this position was articulated brilliantly by a relativist philosopher named "Tsong Khapa" over five hundred years ago, thusly:

  "[l]f there were no place for conventional phenomena, the existence of which is established by the epistemic instruments, these phenomena would be like the snake - that is,
  the rope grasped as a snake - of which no cause or effect is possible. . . .
  [l]f one were forced to maintain that there is no place for bondage, liberation, etc in the
  meaning of “conventional existence/’ and that these must be placed only in the erroneous perspective, that would be a great philosophical error.
  Even worse, as long as convention is conceived [as entirely nonexistent], since there
  would be no role for the epistemic instruments, neither the proposition maintained nor
  the person who maintains it nor the proof - including scriptural sources and reasoning - could be established by epistemic instruments. So it would be ridiculous to maintain
  that there are no genuine phenomena delivered by the epistemic instruments.” {Ocean
  30-31 )15
  
  Tsong khapa makes it plain here that conventional phenomena, unlike the snake
  thought to be perceived when one sees a rope, have causes and effects, and are
  actual. Moreover, he argues that the repudiation of the reality of the conventional
  would undermine the possibility of epistemic authority, undermining even the abil-
  ity to argue cogently that the conventional does not exist. Such a position would
  be self-refuting.

<p>The bizarre thing is that this philosopher was part of a school, known as Madhyamaka, that frequently argued against a lot of down to earth, commonsense worldviews. The thing is, though, they had two positions: 
  <ol>
    <li>The ultimate reality, which is where they argued against the existence of literally everything, including their own positions, and they were well aware of this, and openly admitted exactly this regularly.</li>
    <li>Conventional reality (aka commonsense reality), which is what I've been talking about throughout. </li></ol>
    
  <p>This philosophy school, paradoxically, fiercely defended BOTH positions. In fact, one of the most brilliant thinkers in history, Chandrakirti, was from this school, and wrote an excellent refutation of idealism, while at the same time maintaining the ultimate non existence of everything. Here is Chandrakirti on the matter:</p>
  
  <p>" We [Madhyamikas] do not have the same attitude toward our [concept of] the screen as you [Yogacarins] have toward your [concept of] dependent being (paratantrabhava). With reference to the nature of everyday experience, we say: “Even though things do not exist, they exist” - and this is done for a specified purpose.

  [The things of the world] do not exist for the saints who have abandoned the pyschophysical aggregates and found peace. If, in a similar manner, they did not exist in the context of everyday experience, then we would not maintain that they do - even in this qualified sense.
    
  If everyday experience poses no threat to you, then you may persist in this denial of the evidence provided by such experience. Quarrel with the evidence of everyday experience, and afterward we will rely on the winner.""
-Chandrakirti, translated by C. W. Huntington, The Emptiness of Emptiness</p>
  
  The members of this school saw no conflict in defending both positions, yet, Kumarila Bhatta, also known for his genius and refutation of Buddhist idealism, who was of the Mimamsa school (a very interesting sect of Hinduism, look it up!) certainly noticed, as can be seen by his words on the matter:</p>

<p><p>"Mīmāṃsā refutation of Two Truths Doctrine</p>
  Chattopadhyaya notes that the eighth-century Mīmāṃsā philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa rejected the Two Truths Doctrine in his Shlokavartika. Bhaṭṭa was highly influential with his defence of the Vedic rituals against medieval Buddhist rejections of these rituals. Some believe that his influence contributed to the decline of Buddhism in India[61] since his lifetime coincides with the period in which Buddhism began to decline. According to Kumarila, the two truths doctrine is an idealist doctrine, which conceals the fact that "the theory of the nothingness of the objective world" is absurd: Kumārila Bhaṭṭa:
  
  "The idealist talks of some 'apparent truth' or 'provisional truth of practical life', i.e. in his terminology, of samvriti satya. However, since in his own view, there is really no truth in this 'apparent truth', what is the sense of asking us to look at it as some special brand of truth as it were? If there is truth in it, why call it false at all? And, if it is really false, why call it a kind of truth? Truth and falsehood, being mutually exclusive, there cannot be any factor called 'truth' as belonging in common to both--no more than there can by any common factor called 'treeness' belonging to both the tree and the lion, which are mutually exclusive. On the idealist's own assumption, this 'apparent truth' is nothing but a synonym for the 'false'. Why, then, does he use this expression? Because it serves for him a very important purpose. It is the purpose of a verbal hoax. It means falsity, though with such a pedantic air about it as to suggest something apparently different, as it were. This is in fact a well known trick. Thus, to create a pedantic air, one can use the word vaktrasava [literally mouth-wine] instead of the simpler word lala, meaning saliva [vancanartha upanyaso lala-vaktrasavadivat]. But why is this pedantic air? Why, instead of simply talking of falsity, is the verbal hoax of an 'apparent truth' or samvriti? The purpose of conceiving this samvriti is only to conceal the absurdity of the theory of the nothingness of the objective world, so that it can somehow be explained why things are imagined as actually existing when they are not so. Instead of playing such verbal tricks, therefore, one should speak honestly. This means: one should admit that what does not exist, exists not; and what does exist, exists in the full sense. The latter alone is true, and the former false. But the idealist just cannot afford to do this. He is obliged instead to talk of 'two truths', senseless though this be."

  -Wikipedia page on Two Truths Doctrine, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya (2001). What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy 5th edition. pp. 370–1.</p>

  <p>Regardless, we might take the arguments in a vaccuum, and separate the commonsense defense, and keep the truth in it for our purposes. Certainly, because the other arguments self refute entirely (see Stafford L. Betty's works on Nagarjuna for more on this), leaving only the defense of common sense (Also the title of a great paper by G.E. Moore!) as valid.</p>

  <p>As an interesting aside, while Buddhism is known for its later iterations in the shape of Madhyamaka relativism and Yogacara idealism, the earlier form of Buddhism, Theravada, was overtly realist, as can be seen by the following:</p>

  <p>“If, friends, internally the eye is intact but no external forms come into its range, and there is no corresponding conscious engagement, then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness. If internally the eye is intact and external forms come into its range, but there is no corresponding conscious engagement, then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness."
    -Majjhima Nikaya 28</p>
    
    <p>“Bhikkhus, consciousness comes to be in dependence on a dyad. And how, bhikkhus, does consciousness come to be in dependence on a dyad? In dependence on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness."
      -Samyutta Nikaya 35.93</p>
    
   <p> "A given instance of perceptual consciousness is said to arise only in dependence upon two conditions: the sense organ and its corresponding object-field. This implies that perceptual consciousness arises only in conjunction with an appropriate and existent object; perceptual consciousness of a nonexistent object or without an object is, therefore, impossible."

   <p> “And what is it, bhikkhus, that the wise in the world agree upon as existing, of which I too say that it exists? Form that is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this the wise in the world agree upon as existing, and I too say that it exists."
    -Samyutta Nikaya 22.94</p>
  
    <p>"If we base ourselves on the Pali Nikayas, then we should be compelled to conclude that Buddhism is realistic. There is no explicit denial anywhere of the external world. Nor is there any positive evidence to show that the world is mind-made or simply a projection of subjective thoughts. That Buddhism recognizes the extra-mental existence of matter and the external world is clearly suggested by the texts. Throughout the discourses it is the language of realism that one encounters. The whole Buddhist practical doctrine and discipline, which has the attainment of Nibbana as its final goal, is based on the recognition of the material world and the conscious living beings living therein.""
