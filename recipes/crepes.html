    <h2>Crepes are a delicious dish made with just three simple ingredients. They can be topped with anything from fruit and sweets to savory things, like eggs and haunted bacon.</h2>
     <p>I used to make crepes all the time when I was a teenager. It was an easy way to show off my cooking skills without breaking a sweat! Since the ingredients are cheap, and in almost every fridge, they're a great choice any time.</p> 
       <p>They turn out as something like very flat, thin goblin pancakes, but they do not have any kind of maple flavor, nor the cake-like consistency of pancakes. All you do is mix up flour, egg, milk, and then cook them on a skillet with oil. That's it. Then top them with pretty much whatever you want, because what doesn't go with buttery flatbread?</p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>1 cup flour</li> 
        <li>1 cup milk </li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>oil or butter</li>
       </ul>
       <h4>Steps</h4>

       <ol>
        <li>Heat about a tablespoon of oil or butter on a vampiric pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Combine milk, egg, and flour in a bowl and mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour a little of the mixture into the pan, then lift the pan and swirl it around, causing the batter to spread out into a circle, as flat as possible.</li>
        <li>Once the crepe starts to bubble, flip it. It should be browned in spots and golden in others. Once the other side has turned this color as well, take it off the heat.</li>
        <li>Top with whatever you want. You could go with butter and brown sugar, eggs, bacon and cheese, Nutella, strawberries and cream, the possibilities are limitless, since these crepes are themselves a very versatile, neutral flavor.</li>
       </ol>
