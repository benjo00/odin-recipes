        <h1>Common Sense</h1>

        <p>Common sense is the normal way our minds and senses function. Without language, for example, if we were to be raised by wolves, common sense is all that would be left. All philosophy is language. Hence, no language, no philosophy. This means that the only valid philosopies are those that do not contradict common sense too much.</p>
        <p>Take a simple example. If you are walking in the forest and see a bear and her cubs, you should, and surely would be quite scared. You might carefully walk away, hoping she doesn't see you. You would then turn your back so you can climb up a small rock face, knowing your car is parked over the hill. Now, we can surely agree that this is the most basic function of the mind and senses: keep you safe, keep track of safety and danger. In this scenario, you knew the bear is dangerous, where she was, and where your escape was. If the skeptics and idealists were correct, then all of this data is faulty. This would mean that your fundamental, basic mind and senses are faulty. This would also mean that any data they build or recieve is also faulty, which means that these senses and mind telling you that they have learned that they are faulty cannot be believed, since it would be faulty data. Thus, we are left with two choices:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The mind and senses are unimpeachable, at least within reason, and broadly speaking.</li>
            <li>One must have no position whatsoever, because a person who has faulted the foundations of 100% of their own knowledge cannot have a position that is valid.</li>
        </ol>
