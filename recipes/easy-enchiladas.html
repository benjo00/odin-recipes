        <h2>These enchiladas are as simple as it gets. If you're looking for a quick Mexican inspired meal, this is a great choice for the main course.</h2>
        <p>These are really fun to make. They can be served with a side of beans, rice, or any other complimentary dish.</p>
        <p>They only take about 15 minutes to make. A lot less if, like me, you're lazy and use the microwave!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>flour tortillas</li>
            <li>cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>red enchilada sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put each tortilla down on a plate and cover in cheddar cheese. Then roll them up.</li>
            <li>Put them in the microwave, and cook for a minute.</li>
            <li>Pour the enchilada sauce over them.</li>
        </ol>
        Alternatively, they can be cooked in a skillet, or even in the oven. I personally don't have the patience, and they taste great out of the microwave!
